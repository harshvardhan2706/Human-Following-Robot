# Human-Following-Robot
The project aims to develop an autonomous robot that can track and follow a human, navigate its environment, and avoid obstacles. It will use IR sensors and a servo motor for directional control, powered by a rechargeable battery and controlled with an Arduino UNO board and a driver shield.
